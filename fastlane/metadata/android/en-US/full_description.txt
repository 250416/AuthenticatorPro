Authenticator Pro is a free and open-source 2-factor authentication (2FA) code generator for your online accounts.

• <b>Compatibility</b> : Authenticator Pro is compatible with Google Authenticator. It supports many accounts such as Amazon, Instagram, Microsoft, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, Fortnite and more.

• <b>Backup / Restore</b> : Backup your authenticators with strong encryption. In case you lose your device, you can always gain access to your accounts. Save to cloud storage or to your device.

• <b>Dark Mode</b> : Authenticator Pro has a beautiful material design inspired look in either light or dark modes.

• <b>Icons</b> : Find your authenticators easily with recognisable brand logos and icons next to each code.

• <b>Categories</b> : Organise your authenticators into categories.

• <b>Few Permissions</b> : Authenticator Pro only uses basic permissions and does not require Internet access to function.

• <b>Secure</b> : All authenticators are stored securely on your device with an encrypted database.

• <b>Customisation</b> : Set icons and rename. You can also arrange your authenticators in any order you like so you can find them easily.

Authenticator Pro is also available as a Wear OS companion app. Quickly view your authenticators directly from your watch. Please note that a connection to your Android device is required.

2 Factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring the use of a one time code to log in. In addition to your username and password, you will need a code provided by Authenticator Pro. So even if your login details are compromised, your account remains safe.
