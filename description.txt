ProAuth generates 2 factor authentication (2FA) codes for your online accounts.

2 Factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring the use of a one time code to log in. In addition to your username and password, you will need a code provided by ProAuth. So even if hackers stole your login details, your account remains safe.

ProAuth supports TOTP (Time Based) and HOTP (Counter Based) authenticators using either SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 hashing algorithms.
